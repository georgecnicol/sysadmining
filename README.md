sysadmining
===========

things I write that I use.

alterDisklist.py - we use amanda to make backups. Sometimes it breaks. If I want to be certain that everything got backed up that was supposed to get backed up I can use this tool. It wants the list of what should get done, and the log files (amdump/ amflush - which you can concatenate) and then gives you a new disklist if there is incomplete problems. Written originally on Christmas eve, becuase that's how things go.

alterDisklist - One Christmas eve amanda, an open source tool for creating backups, took a dump (what I did there, did you see it?). I wrote this to help get things back on track.

copyEmacsVim - needed to move some student directories from point a to point b.

gcrunaway - ssh for loop, one of the first tools that I ever wrote in bash to help me do something useful.

ipRemover.py - sometimes you get an exclusion list after the fact.

nmap2list.bash - fast enough for smallish to medium networks to turn nmap results into a list that can then be compared to netstat -naob results (or similar) using some other tool that will probably show up here at some point.
